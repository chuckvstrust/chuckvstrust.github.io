You’re finally sitting down to check your personal email after a long day. You’ve got 36 unread messages and maybe one drop of brainpower left. Then one subject line jumps out:

**Account Warning: Your access will be locked in 12 hours**

Your heart skips while a jolt of adrenaline hits you. You’re already halfway to clicking the link before your brain even gets a vote.

That panic? It’s not a flaw, it’s a feature.

Your brain has a “fast mode” which psychologists call System 1. It reacts instantly to perceived danger, skips the details, and pushes you to act now.

That’s great if you’re stepping off a curb and into traffic. Online? It’s a security hole.

Attackers design urgency on purpose: short deadlines, scary warnings, final notices. These are all meant to hijack your instincts before reason steps in.

This is why your first move from our T.R.U.S.T. toolkit should be S for Stop.

Even a brief pause interrupts the automatic panic, giving your slower, more deliberate System 2 thinking a chance to engage. The goal isn't a specific number of seconds. You may only take 5 seconds to make the shift where I may need 5 minutes to calm down and remove myself from the situation. By giving your brain the space to shift from reaction to reflection, you take your power back.

Remember:

- Urgency is a feeling, not a fact.
- A real problem can wait at least five seconds (or longer).

So, Stop. Breathe. Then decide.
That might mean deleting the email.
Or texting your boss to double-check.
Either way. You control the next move.

Next time, we’ll explore a different trick attackers love: how familiarity fools your brain into trusting the wrong things, and how T for Think helps you snap you out of it.
