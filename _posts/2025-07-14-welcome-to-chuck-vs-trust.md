Hey there, I’m Chuck.

Let's be honest: blind trust is the most dangerous thing in our digital lives. (read that again)

It's the assumption that https://www.google.com/search?q=safe+browsing+site+status is safe, an email is legitimate, or a voice is real. And it's what gets us into trouble.

This is where I come in. On this blog and my YouTube channel, “Chuck vs Trust,” I’m cutting through the noise. I’m not just looking at the tools and methods used to trick us, but why we fall for these tricks. I’m here to break down those digital myths, explore the subtle ways our trust gets messed with, and most importantly, show you how to actually verify what’s real.

I’m a security awareness guy, and I truly believe the best way to learn this stuff is through real stories. So, expect me to share scenarios that hit close to home; you know, the kind of situations you might actually face. As time goes on, I’ll introduce technical methods used to show you what’s behind the curtain so you can see the bigger picture of what’s really going on.

And hey, who says security awareness can’t be fun? I’ll occasionally add in memes and practical tips you can share with your friends, family, or even use for your office’s next cybersecurity awareness campaign. My goal is to make all this “trust” stuff click for everyone.

In the weeks leading up to starting this blog, I wanted to build Chuck vs Trust on a few simple ideas:

- Kaizen: Constant, practical improvement beats wishful thinking every time.
- Focus: Cut through the noise and zero in on real digital risks.
- Skepticism: Don’t just accept digital myths; dig deeper and ask the tough questions.
- Community: Security’s better together; we share what we learn, because trust is a team sport.

I'll be dropping new posts every Tuesday. For my innagural post, my focus will be within the firewall (I'm talking about us).

I'm glad you’re here.
