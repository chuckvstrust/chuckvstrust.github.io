Welcome to the trust battleground. I'm Chuck.

In the online world, it's too easy to slip up, get tricked, or simply hand over info we shouldn't. Blind trust is our biggest risk, and that’s exactly what I'm here to fix with *Chuck vs Trust*.

Expect weekly deep dives into the psychology of digital deception, practical tips you can share with anyone, and stories that'll stick with you. I'll reveal the sneaky techniques attackers use, break down common myths, and give you straightforward advice on how to spot what’s real.

This isn't your typical security awareness blog: expect memes, real talk, and a dose of humor (because protecting yourself should never be boring).

Trust me during this journey....or better yet, verify.

I'm glad you're here.
